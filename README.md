# MemoryMatch
Some of my college work in C++. The user decides to randomize a number board or not, then tries to match number pairs on it. Runs from Memory.cpp

How to play:
For y or n? put either y or n to randomize number positions or not. Not randomizing is good for testing it or seeing how the game works.

After it will ask for a pair, as in an x then y coordinate, to see a position. 

Ensure to input a single number then <enter key> for the x then repeate for the y coordinate. Y is top to bottom 1-4, x is 1-4 going left to right
